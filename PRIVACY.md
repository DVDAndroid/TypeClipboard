TypeClipboard does one thing, and one thing only: type (through a virtual keyboard) the contents of the clipboard.

It does not:
  - store clipboard information
  - process clipboard information
  - send your data over the internet, especially not to dodgy hackers

That's it.

Sorry this isn't 333 pages long...
