# TypeClipboard

For IT professionals everywhere who are sick of typing long complex passwords into remote consoles. Just copy the password into your clipboard, select the password box, and press F8 or click Type!

(Doesn't have to be a password either, also useful for URLs, Base64-encoded things, etc.)

Also, if you don't want to compile yourself, this is also available in the Windows Store:

Tested with a wide variety of consoles, including vSphere, Horizon (HTML5), and Citrix. There is a known issue where VMWare Horizon's client seems to be using a very low-level keyboard driver, so it doesn't work with it. Sorry.
